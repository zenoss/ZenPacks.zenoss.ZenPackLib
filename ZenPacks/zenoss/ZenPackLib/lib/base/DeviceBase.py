        The status number is the number of critical events associated
        with this device. This includes only events tagger with the
        device's UUID, and not events affecting components of the
        device.

        None is returned when the device's status is unknown because it
        isn't being monitored, or because there was an error retrieving
        its events.

        This method is overridden here to provide a simpler default
        meaning for "down". By default any critical severity event that
        is in either the new or acknowledged state in the /Status event
        class and is tagged with the device's UUID indicates that the
        device is down. An alternate event class (statusclass) can be
        provided, which is what would be done by the device's
        getPingStatus and getSnmpStatus methods.

        A key different between this methods behavior vs. that of the
        Device.getStatus method it overrides is that warning and error
        events are not considered as affecting the device's status.
