# Nothing is required in this __init__.py, but it is an excellent place to do
# many things in a ZenPack.
#
# The example below which is commented out by default creates a custom subclass
# of the ZenPack class. This allows you to define custom installation and
# removal routines for your ZenPack. If you don't need this kind of flexibility
# you should leave the section commented out and let the standard ZenPack
# class be used.
#
# Code included in the global scope of this file will be executed at startup
# in any Zope client. This includes Zope itself (the web interface) and zenhub.
# This makes this the perfect place to alter lower-level stock behavior
# through monkey-patching.
