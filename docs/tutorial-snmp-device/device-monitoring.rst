*****************
Device Monitoring
*****************

This section will cover monitoring device-level metrics using SNMP. This
requires no code, and you can find instructions for doing it in the normal
Zenoss documentation. However, there are some extra considerations and steps
required to package your configuration in a ZenPack.

.. note::

    Commands in this section should be run on the host as the *zenoss* user
    unless otherwise noted.

Create a ZenPack
================

The first step will be to create and install a ZenPack to contain all of the
NetBotz monitoring functionality we're going to build.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /z
    zenpacklib --create ZenPacks.training.NetBotz
    zenpack --link --install ZenPacks.training.NetBotz

We should also restart at least *Zope* after installing the ZenPack so that we
can work with it in the web interface.

.. code-block:: bash

    serviced service restart Zope

Create a Device Class
=====================

To support our new NetBotz environmental sensor device we will want to create a
new device class. This will give us full control over how these types of devices
are modeled and monitored. Use the following steps to add a new device class.

1. Navigate to the *Infrastructure* view.

2. Select the root of the *DEVICES* tree.

3. Click the *+* button at the bottom of the list to add a new organizer.

4. Set the *Name* to ``NetBotz`` then click *SUBMIT*.

   The new *NetBotz* device will now be selected. We'll want to check on some
   important configuration properties using the following steps.

Set Device Class Properties
---------------------------

1. Click the *DETAILS* button at the top of the list.

2. Select *Modeler Plugins*.

   The modeler plugins are what model information about the device. We should
   see a list something like the following. This list is being acquired from the
   root (/ or /Devices) device class.

   - zenoss.snmp.NewDeviceMap
   - zenoss.snmp.DeviceMap
   - zenoss.snmp.InterfaceMap
   - zenoss.snmp.RouteMap

   This is a good basic list that uses standard MIB-2 support that works with
   most SNMP-enabled devices. However, it's unlikely that we care about the
   routing table on our environmental sensors, so there's no reason to model it.

3. Remove *zenoss.snmp.RouteMap* from the list.

4. Click *Save*.

   Now you can see the *Path* at which our modeler plugin configuration is set
   has changed from */* to */NetBotz*. This allows us to know that regardless of
   what the user sets their default modeler plugins to in the system that
   NetBotz appliances will be collected using the set of modeler plugins we
   configure here.

5. Select *Configuration Properties* from the left navigation pane.

   There are a lot of configuration properties. You don't have to worry about
   understanding all of them. However, some will be critical to monitoring
   NetBotz appliances. We know that we're going to be using SNMP so let's make
   sure that it's enabled.

6. Find the *zSnmpMonitorIgnore* property and set its value to true.

7. Now set the value for *zSnmpMonitorIgnore* to false.

   The reason for flipping the value back to it's original value is the same as
   saving the list of modeler plugins. While the system default is to have SNMP
   monitoring enabled, a user could easily disable it globally and cause our
   NetBotz monitoring to stop working. By flipping the value, we've set it
   locally within our device class and will prevent changes in the global
   default from affecting the operation of our ZenPack.

Add Device Class to ZenPack
---------------------------

Now that we've setup the NetBotz device class, it's time to add it to our
ZenPack using the following steps. Adding a device class to your ZenPack causes
all settings in that device class to be added to the ZenPack. This includes
modeler plugin configuration, configuration property values and monitoring
templates.

1. Make sure that you have the NetBotz device class selected in the
   *Infrastructure* view.

2. Choose *Add to ZenPack* from the gear menu in the bottom-left.

3. Select your NetBotz ZenPack then click *SUBMIT*.


Add a NetBotz Device
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This would be a great time to add a NetBotz device to our new */NetBotz* device
class. We haven't done anything in the way of customer monitoring. It can often
be helpful to see what Zenoss' default settings will return for a device before
we start adding features.

You can add a the device through the web interface, or on the command line
using zendisc as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    z zendisc run --deviceclass=/NetBotz --device=172.17.0.1

.. note::

   I'll often use *zendisc* from the command line only because the *zenjobs*
   daemon must be running to add jobs from the web interface. The *zenjobs*
   daemon is not required to be running when adding devices using *zendisc* from
   the command line because it immediately adds the device instead of scheduling
   a job to do it.

You should now see that Zenoss was able to model some information about the
device even though we haven't added any custom monitoring. For example, you
should see the following on the device in the web interface.

- Overview

  - Hardware Manufacturer: NetBotz
  - Hardware Model: .1.3.6.1.4.1.5528.100.20.10.2006
  - OS Manufacturer: Unknown
  - OS Model: Linux 2.4.26

- Components
  - Interfaces: 2 - eth0 and lo

If we were running the *zenperfsnmp* daemon, we'd start to see that Zenoss was
monitoring the uptime and interface metrics after about 10 minutes.

Configure Monitoring Templates
==============================

Before adding a monitoring template we should look to see what monitoring
templates are already being used in our new device class.

Validate Existing Monitoring Templates
--------------------------------------

We created the NetBotz device class directly within the root (or /) device
class. This means that we'll be inheriting the system default monitoring
templates and binding. Use the following steps to validate this.

1. Select the *NetBotz* device class in the *Infrastructure* view.

2. Choose *Bind Templates* from the gear menu in the bottom-left.

   You should only see ``Device (/Devices)`` in the *Selected* box. Depending on
   what other ZenPacks you have installed in the system you may see zero or more
   other templates listed in the *Available* box.

   Now we investigate what this system default *Device* monitoring template does.

3. Click *CANCEL* on the *Bind Templates* dialog.

4. Click the *DETAILS* button at the top of the device class tree.

5. Select ``Device (/Devices)`` under *Monitoring Templates*.

   You'll see that there's a single SNMP datasource named sysUpTime. If you
   expand this datasource you will see that it contains a single datapoint which
   is also named sysUpTime. This single datapoint named the same as its
   containing datasource is always what you'll see for SNMP datasources. The
   reason for having the conceptual separation between datasources and
   datapoints is that other types of datasources such as COMMAND are capable of
   returning multiple datapoints.

   You'll note that this monitoring template has no threshold or graphs defined.
   This is unusual. Typically there'd be no reason to collect data that you
   weren't going to either threshold against or show in a graph. The *sysUpTime*
   datapoint is an exception because it is shown on a device's *Overview* page
   in the *Uptime* field and therefore doesn't need to be graphed.

Let's use ``snmpwalk`` to check if our NetBotz device supports *sysUpTime*. The
OID listed for the *sysUpTime* datasource is ``1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0`` so we run the
following command::

    # snmpwalk 172.17.0.1 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0
    DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (7275488) 20:12:34.88

This response indicates that the NetBotz device does support the *sysUpTime*
OID. This is a mandatory field for SNMP devices to support so you will be able
to get it in almost all cases.

Add a Monitoring Template
-------------------------

Now that we've validated that the existing *Device* monitoring template will
work on our NetBotz device, we'll add another monitoring template to collect
additional information.

.. note::

   We could create a local copy of the *Device* monitoring template in the
   NetBotz device class and add new datasources, thresholds and graphs to it.
   However, this prevents us from taking advantage of changes made to the system
   default *Device* template in the future.

Follow these steps to create and bind a new template to the NetBotz device
class.

1. Navigate to *Advanced* -> *Monitoring Templates*.

2. Click the *+* button in the bottom-left to add a template.

  1. Set the *Name* field to ``NetBotzDevice``.
  2. Set the *Template Path* field to */NetBotz*.

3. Click *SUBMIT*.

4. Bind this template to the *NetBotz* device class.

  1. Navigate to *Infrastructure*.
  2. Select the *NetBotz* device class.
  3. Choose *Bind Templates* from the gear menu in the bottom-left.
  4. Move *NetBotzDevice* from available to selected.
  5. Click *SAVE*.

Build the Monitoring Template
-----------------------------

Now that we've created the *NetBotzDevice* monitoring template and bound it to
the *NetBotz* device class, we need to add datasources, thresholds and graphs.
We don't already know what might be interesting to graph for each NetBotz
device, so let's go exploring with ``snmpwalk``::

    # snmpwalk 172.17.0.1 .1.3
    SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0 = STRING: Linux Netbotz01 2.4.26 #1 Wed Oct 31 18:09:53 CDT 2007 ppc
    SNMPv2-MIB::sysObjectID.0 = OID: NETBOTZV2-MIB::netBotz420ERack
    ... lots of lines removed ...
    SNMPv2-MIB::snmpInTotalReqVars.0 = Counter32: 4406
    ... and more removed ...

There isn't much of interest to collect at the device level. By "device-level" I
mean values that only have a single instance for the device. Typical examples of
these kinds of metrics would be memory utilization or the previous sysUpTime
example. With SNMP it can be easy to find these kinds of single-instance values
because their OID ends in ``.0`` as in ``SNMPv2-MIB::snmpInTotalReqVars.0``.

.. note::

   We'll get into monitoring multi-instance values in the component monitoring
   section.

Since there aren't any extremely interesting single-instance values to collect,
we'll collect that snmpInTotalReqVars for illustrative purposes. We'll need to
know the numeric OID for this value. Use snmptranslate to find it::

    # snmptranslate -On SNMPv2-MIB::snmpInTotalReqVars.0
    .1.3.6.1.2.1.11.13.0

Add an SNMP Datasource
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the steps below to add an SNMP datasource for snmpInTotalReqVars.

1. Navigate to *Advanced* -> *Monitoring Templates*.

2. Expand *NetBotzDevice* then select */NetBotz*.

3. Click *+* on the *Data Sources* pane.

  1. Set *Name* to ``snmpInTotalReqVars``
  2. Set *Type* to ``SNMP``
  3. Click *SUBMIT*.

  .. note::

     Best practice is to name SNMP datasources according to the name of the OID
     that's being polled from the MIB.

4. Double-click to edit the *snmpInTotalReqVars* datasource.

  1. Set *OID* to ``1.3.6.1.2.1.11.13.0``
  2. Click *SAVE*.

  .. warning::

     A common mistake to make when setting the OID in a device-level template is
     to omit the trailing ``.0``. The reason this is common is that if you were
     using the MIB as reference instead of the snmpwalk above, you'd see that
     the OID for SNMPv2-MIB::snmpInTotalReqVars was 1.3.6.1.2.1.11.13 instead of
     1.3.6.1.2.1.11.13.0. Due to this, I always recommend using snmpwalk to
     verify exactly what OID you should be polling.

     While Zenoss will accept the OID with the leading ``.``, I recommend
     omitting it. It isn't necessary.

We now have a choice about how we want to handle the value that comes back from
polling that OID. As you can see above in the snmpwalk output, it is a
*Counter32* type. This means that it starts at 0 and, in this case, increments
each time an SNMP variable is requested. The most common way to handle counters
like these is as a delta. It's not very interesting to know how many variables
have been requested since the device last rebooted, but it might be interesting
to know how many variables are requested per second.

The default type for a datapoint is *GAUGE* which would record the actual value
you see in the snmpwalk output. If we'd rather monitor the rate of requests,
we'd change the datapoint type to *DERIVE* using the following steps.

1. Double-click on the *snmpInTotalReqVars.snmpInTotalReqVars* datapoint.

  You may need to expand the *snmpInTotalReqVars* datasource first.

  1. Set *RRD Type* to *DERIVE*
  2. Set *RRD Minimum* to ``0``
  3. Click *SAVE*.

.. warning::

  It is very important to always set the *RRD Minimum* to ``0`` for *DERIVE*
  type datapoints. If you fail to do this, you will get large negative spikes in
  your data anytime the device reboots or the counter resets for any other
  reason.

  The only time you wouldn't set a minimum of 0 is when the value you're
  monitoring can increase and decrease and you're interested in tracking rates
  of negative change as well as rates of positive change.

Add a Threshold
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we can add a threshold to our monitoring template. Let's say we want to
raise a warning event anytime the rate of SNMP variable requests exceeds 10 per
second. This can be done with the following steps.

1. Click *+* on the *Thresholds* pane.

  1. Set *Name* to ``high SNMP variable request rate``
  2. Set *Type* to *MinMaxThreshold*
  3. Click *ADD*.

2. Double-click to edit the *high SNMP variable request rate* threshold.

  1. Drag the *snmpInTotalReqVars* datapoint to the left box.
  2. Set *Severity* to *Warning*
  3. Set *Maximum Value* to ``10``
  4. Set *Event Class* to */Perf/Snmp*
  5. Click *SAVE*.

.. note::

   A *MinMaxThreshold* can be used to handle a variety of conditions including
   over a maximum value, under a minimum value, outside a defined range or
   within a defined range. See the regular Zenoss documentation for how to use
   each of these options.

Add a Graph Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we'll add a graph so the user will be able to see the trend of SNMP variable
requests per second over time. This can be done with the following steps.

1. Click *+* on the *Graph Definitions* pane.

  1. Set *Name* to ``SNMP Rates``
  2. Click *SUBMIT*.

2. Double-click to edit the *SNMP Rates* graph definition.

  1. Set *Units* to ``requests/sec``
  2. Set *Min Y* to ``0``
  3. Click *SUBMIT*.

  .. note::

     Always set the units for your graph. Also set the minimum Y axis and
     maximum Y axis values if you know what the possible limits are for the
     data. This results in graphs that are easier to read.

     The format field should also be tweaked to best present the kind of data
     that is to be graphed. You can find more information on what can be used in
     the format field in the *RRDtool rrdgraph_graph* documentation under the
     *PRINT* section.

3. Select the *SNMP Rates* graph definition.

4. Choose *Manage Graph Points* from the gear menu.

  1. Choose *Data Point* from the *+* menu.
  2. Set *Data Point* to *snmpInTotalReqVars*
  3. Check *Include Related Thresholds*
  4. Click *SUBMIT*

5. Double-click to edit the *snmpInTotalReqVars* graph point.

  1. Set *Name* to ``Variables``
  2. Click *SAVE*.

  .. note::

     The name of a graph point is what is displayed for it in the graph legend.
     You should always choose something short that describes the data and makes
     sense in context of the units chosen above.

Test Monitoring Template
========================

The quick way to check if we've been successful in creating and binding our
monitoring template is to navigate to the NetBotz device we added to the system
and verify that we see our *NetBotzDevice (/NetBotz)* monitoring template listed
at the bottom of the device's left navigation pane.

Now we can test that our datasource will be collected by running the following
command to do a single collection of the NetBotz device:

.. code-block:: bash

    z zenperfsnmp run -v10 --device=Netbotz01

We can look through the output to see what zenperfsnmp does. I usually look for
any lines that contain *MetricWriter*. These lines will show the collected data
being published to the database. If data isn't collected, these lines won't be
present. Because of this you might run the following command instead to only see
lines that contain this pattern:

.. code-block:: bash

    z zenperfsnmp run -v10 --device=Netbotz01 | grep "MetricWriter"

We should see about 18 datapoints being published. You'll see two of
*eventQueueLength*, *sysUpTime*, 14 interface datapoints and our custom
*snmpInTotalReqVars* in there somewhere.

Export the ZenPack
==================

Now that we've created a ZenPack and added some configuration to it, we need to
export it. Exporting a ZenPack takes all of the object's you've added to your
ZenPack through the web interface and compiles them into an ``objects.xml`` file
that gets saved into your ZenPack's source directory in the file system.

Follow these steps to export a ZenPack.

1. Navigate to *Advanced* -> *ZenPacks* -> *Your ZenPack* in the web
   interface.

2. Scroll to the bottom of the page to see what objects the ZenPack provides.

   All objects listed in the *ZenPack Provides* section and objects contained
   within them will be exported.

3. Choose *Export ZenPack* from the gear menu in the bottom-left of the screen.

4. Choose to only export and not download then click *OK*.

   You could also choose to download the ZenPack through your web browser.
   However, the downloaded file will be the built *egg* distribution format of
   the ZenPack. This means that it can be installed into other Zenoss systems,
   but is not suitable for further development.

This will export everything under *ZenPack Provides* to a directory within your
ZenPack's source called *objects/*. No other files in your ZenPack's source
directory are created or modified. You can find this file in a path such as the
following.

    /z/ZenPacks.acme.Widgeter/ZenPacks/acme/Widgeter

Each time you add a new object to you ZenPack within the web interface, or
modify an object that's already contained within your ZenPack, you should
export the ZenPack again to update objects.xml. If you're using version control
on your ZenPack's source directory this would be a good time to commit the
resulting changes.

.. warning::

   Exporting a ZenPack overwrites files in the *objects/* directory. For this
   reason it is recommended that files in this directory never be modified by
   hand.
