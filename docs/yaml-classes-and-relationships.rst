Classes and Relationships
#########################

Classes and relationships form the model that forms the basis for everything
Zenoss does. Classes are things like *Device*, *FileSystem*, *IpInterface* and
*OSProcess*. Relationships state things like a *Device* contains many
*FileSystems*. You will need to extend this model when the standard classes and
relationships don't adequately represent the model of a target your ZenPack is
attempting to monitor. For example, a XenServer ZenPack needs to represent
concepts like pools, storage repositories and virtual machines.


.. _standard-classes:

****************
Standard Classes
****************

The standard classes exist on all Zenoss systems. If these are the only types of
things you care to model and monitor then you may not need to create your own
classes or relationships.

* Device

  * DeviceHW (hw)

    * CPU (hw/cpus)
    * ExpansionCard (hw/cards)
    * Fan (hw/fans)
    * HardDisk (hw/harddisks)
    * PowerSupply (hw/powersupplies)
    * TemperatureSensor (hw/temperaturesensors)

  * OperatingSystem (os)

    * FileSystem (os/filesystems)
    * IpInterface (os/interfaces)
    * IpRouteEntry (os/routes)
    * OSProcess (os/processes)
    * IpService (os/ipservices)
    * WinService (os/winservices)


.. _zenpacklib-classes:

*******
Classes
*******

If you need more than the standard classes provide, you will need to extend one
of the following two base classes provided by zenpacklib.

* zenpacklib.Device

* zenpacklib.Component

  * zenpacklib.HWComponent

    * zenpacklib.CPU
    * zenpacklib.ExpansionCard
    * zenpacklib.Fan
    * zenpacklib.HardDisk
    * zenpacklib.PowerSupply
    * zenpacklib.TemperatureSensor

  * zenpacklib.OSComponent

    * zenpacklib.FileSystem
    * zenpacklib.IpInterface
    * zenpacklib.IpRouteEntry
    * zenpacklib.OSProcess

    * zenpacklib.Service

      * zenpacklib.IpService
      * zenpacklib.WinService

You use *zenpacklib.Device* to create new device types of which instances will
appear on the *Infrastructure* screen. You use *zenpacklib.Component* to create
new component types of which instances will appear under *Components* on a
device's left navigation pane. Frequently when ZenPacks need to add new classes,
they will add a single new device type with many new components types. For
example, a XenServer ZenPack would add a new device type called *Endpoint* which
represents the XenAPI management interface. That *Endpoint* device type would
have many components of types such as *Pool*, *StorageRepository* and
*VirtualMachine*.

The other supported classes are proxies for their platform equivalents, and are
to be used when you want to extend one of the platform component types rather
than creating a totally new component type.


.. _zenpacklib-relationships:

*************
Relationships
*************

Relationships are Zenoss' way of saying objects are related to each other. For
example, the *DeviceHW* class contains many CPUs of the *CPU* class. You must
also declare relationships between classes in your ZenPack. If you only declare
types based on *zenpacklib.Device* you don't have to do this because they'll
automatically have a relationship to their containing device class among other
things. However, you must define at least a containing relationship for every
type based on *zenpacklib.Component* you create. This is because components
aren't contained in any relationship by default, and every object in Zenoss must
be contained somewhere.

zenpacklib supports the following types of relationships.

* One-to-Many Containing (1:MC)
* One-to-Many (1:M)
* Many-to-Many (M:M)
* One-to-One (1:1)

It's important to understand the different between containing and non-containing
relationships. Each component type must be contained by exactly one
relationship. Beyond that a device or component type may have as many non-
containing relationships as you like. This is because every object in Zenoss has
a single primary path that describes where it is stored in the tree that is the
Zenoss object database.

A simplified version of XenServer's classes and relationships provides for a
good example. The following list of relationship states the following: An
endpoint contains zero or more pools, each pool contains zero or more storage
repositories and virtual machines, and each storage repository is related to
zero or more virtual machines.

* Endpoint 1:MC Pool
* Pool 1:MC StorageRepository
* Pool 1:MC VirtualMachine
* StorageRepository M:M VirtualMachine


.. _adding-classes-and-relationships:

********************************
Adding Classes and Relationships
********************************

To add classes and relationships to `zenpack.yaml` you add entries to the
top-level *classes* and *class_relationships* fields. The following example
shows a XenServer *Endpoint* device type along with *Pool*, *StorageRepository*,
and *VirtualMachine* component types.

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: ZenPacks.example.XenServer

    classes:
      DEFAULTS:
        base: [zenpacklib.Component]

      XenServerEndpoint:
        base: [zenpacklib.Device]
        label: Endpoint

      XenServerPool:
        label: Pool

        properties:
          ha_enabled:
            type: boolean
            label: HA Enabled
            short_label: HA

          ha_allow_overcommit:
            type: boolean
            label: HA Allow Overcommit
            short_label: Overcommit

      XenServerStorageRepository:
        label: Storage Repository

        properties:
          physical_size:
            type: int
            label: Physical Size
            short_label: Size

      XenServerVirtualMachine:
        label: Virtual Machine

        properties:
          vcpus_at_startup:
            type: int
            label: vCPUs at Startup
            short_label: vCPUs

    class_relationships:
      - XenServerEndpoint 1:MC XenServerPool
      - XenServerPool 1:MC XenServerStorageRepository
      - XenServerPool 1:MC XenServerVirtualMachine
      - XenServerStorageRepository M:M XenServerVirtualMachine

.. note::

  DEFAULTS can be used in classes just like in zProperties to avoid repetitively
  setting the same field for many entries. Note specifically how XenServerPool,
  XenServerStorageRepository and XenServerVirtualMachine will inherit the
  default while XenServerEndpoint overrides it.

Classes and their properties allow for a wide range of control. See the
following section for details.
